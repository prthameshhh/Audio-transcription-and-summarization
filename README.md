# Audio-transcription-and-summarization
This script employs OpenAI's Whisper model for audio transcription, Mistral 7B for text summarization, and Gradio for interactivity. It configures the text generation pipeline, defines summarization helper functions, and integrates audio transcription with summarization. It's a powerful tool for interactive text summarization tasks.



# Interactive Text Summarization Tool

This project is an interactive tool that combines the power of various state-of-the-art models for audio transcription, text summarization, and user interaction. It leverages the following technologies:

- **OpenAI Whisper**: A robust speech recognition model for audio transcription.
- **Mistral 7B**: A large language model for various text related tasks.
- **Gradio**: A user-friendly library for building interactive interfaces in Python.

## Features

- **Audio Transcription**: Transcribe audio files or recordings into text using OpenAI Whisper.
- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of lengthy text documents using Mistral 7B.
- **Interactive Interface**: Enjoy a seamless user experience with Gradio's intuitive interface.

## Usage 


1. The Gradio interface will open in your default web browser.
2. Upload an audio file to see the transcription and the summary in article format.
3. Adjust the summarization parameters as desired.
4. Click the "Summarize" button to generate the summary.
